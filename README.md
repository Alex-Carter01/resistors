## Resistors
this was the first semester final for the web apps class
the front page requires you to enter a first and last name, which is then stored in a cookie along with its hash

the resistor page is fairly self explanaitory, but it lets you input the colors of a resistor, and will then tell you the ohmage

this is deployed at the same website that is associated with this repo (http://carter-lasa-resistors.appspot.com/)

the two images should be moved to /images but i havent had access to bash in a while
